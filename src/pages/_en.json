      "description": "Your mothership is in heavy disrepair, you and your fellow astronaut need to gather resources and investigated this hostile planet that your board computer seems to be weirdly obsessed with. As members of a special unit of trained Scouts and Engineers it is up to you two to go out and gather what is needed to get your ship into working condition again, enduring the hostile environment and possibly left over autonomous machines from a bygone war, fighting every humanoid they will encounter. Time is of the essence, as you do not know how long the conditions are stable enough for you to take off again, can you find out what is going on on sal_03x3, gather enough resources and make it back in one piece?",
